- Background color: Light blue (#EBF4FA), a desaturated shade of the primary, to provide a calm backdrop.
- Accent color: A gentle green (#A3E4D7) for approvals and positive balance displays, analogous to the blue primary. 
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and short text, combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 
- Use clear and minimalist icons for expense categories and actions. 
- Design a clean, card-based layout for displaying expenses and group information.
- Subtle animations for approval confirmations and balance updates.
